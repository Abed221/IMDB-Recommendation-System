### This is a simple project done to practice the basics of data analysis

1. Importing Data
   - Importing Live datasets
   - Importing from multiple sources
2. Cleaning
   - Removing missing data
   - Cleaning outliers and unrelated data cells
   - Filtering the unnecessary media types
3. Exploratory analysis to find insights
   - Finding hidden relationships between columns
   - Plotting to see the outliers and our data distribution 
4. Find the right metrics to produce recommendations
   - Using the most related values to make up a predictor
   - Removing the less accurate predictor to up the effeciency
